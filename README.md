HOW THE ELECTIONS ARE CONDUCTED
One Year Before the Elections Republicans and Democrats are the two main political parties in the United States. The two parties start their campaigns a year before the elections by assembling their teams and beginning their nationwide fundraising and support-seeking travels. As soon as a campaign is underway, the parties engage in televised debates to defend their positions and ideas.

Candidates are chosen directly by the voters in U.S. elections. However, voters do not directly elect the president and vice president. Instead, they are picked by "electors" through the Electoral College process.

The Constitution is the source of the electoral process. It was a compromise between a vote in Congress and a vote by the general public.

The Electors Each state receives the same number of electors as members of Congress (House and Senate). Including the three electors from Washington, D.C., there are presently 538 electors in total.

The political parties in each state pick their own list of prospective voters. Per whom, how, and when electors are chosen differs by state.

What Is the Process of the Electoral College?
Your vote is added to a statewide tally once you cast your presidential ballot. The victor receives all of the electoral votes for that state in the remaining 48 states and Washington, D.C. The electors in Maine and Nebraska are distributed according to a proportional system.

In order to win the presidency, a candidate must receive the support of at least 270 electors, or more than half of all electors in the United States.

A projected winner is typically declared on election night in November following your vote. But when the electors gather in their states around the middle of December, that's when the actual Electoral College vote happens. The Constitution does not mandate that electors support the candidate who won the popular vote in their state, but some states do. When an elector casts a ballot for someone else, their state may punish them, remove them from office and replace them with another elector, or even bring legal action against them.

The prupose of this project is to rank states by decreasing number of grand electors per capita. The first states in the list will be the most valuable since you get a large number of grand electors by convincing a small number of people to vote for you.
